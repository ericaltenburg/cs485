## Video Games for Veterans

#. PTSD Therapy
	- exposure therapy
	- confront what people fear
	- vets can't see combat again, except through VR
	- not widely used
#. Stakeholders
	- Potential patients for VR-CBT
		- being very beneficial if suffering from anxiety/personality disorders
			- during trial and 6 months after, 33\% lower levels of momentary anxiety
		- BRAVEMIND used to recreate scenes where they may have experienced traumatic events
			- over 60 locations in active duty military locations
	- Producers of VR software and hardware
		- BRAVEMIND funded by taxpayer dollars and developed through the US Army
			- USC
		- Psios, private producer of AR and VR therapy based software, has their own responsibility to its shareholders and to the public
	- Gov and healthcare providers
		- vets in America are provided healthcare through services like VA (veterans assoc.) while others rely on Medicaid or nothing at all
		- Poverty/homelessness crisis is largely a symptom of mental health disaster facing this country
		- Without getting past the middleman in healthcare, this likely won't end up being widely used as it is very expensive
#. Dangers of VR in therapy 
	- physical side effects
		- cybersickness (5 senses are de-synced)
		- after effects
		- Solution: pre-screening patients and focusing on recalibration after and using use
		- Solution: decrease levels of immersion
	- Patients with cognitive abilities
		- can cause altered sense of reality in which reality and the virtual env. are indistinguishable
		- limited self-awareness
	- Many studies not done on patients with cognitive disabilities, only on healthy patients
#. Ethical issues
	- Therapists using VR w/o experience
		- Concern about using VR without knowing how to use it or using something outside of their expertise
		- Should be a tool, they should know how to use it before using it
		- Almost like VR is a buzzword to them and so they hop on the bandwagon since it's popular but they don't know how to use it
	- Damage to the therapist-client relationship
	- VR used to hide weak clinical skills
		- Dying clinician/therapist, they use VR as a means to bring in more clients when they may not know how to use it, still going to be a bad clinician
	- Overstated claims to the success and applications of VR in medicine
		- can lead to partially developed tech being pushed into production, since it's such high expectations it can create timeline issues hence the underdeveloped product being pushed
#. Code of ethics
	- 1.2 Avoid Harm
		- Therapy is delicate, must keep this in mind, one simple mistake can be consequential
	- 1.3 Be honest and trustworthy
		- Not every treatment works for everyone, so people must know the risks involved this way they don't push this onto everyone when it may not work
		- "know when to use it"
		- Here are the pros and cons, don't just give pros
	- 2.1 
		- Vr could be used by many many, so it must be made to the highest standard
	- 2.6
		- make sure to develop within their own domain
		- consult when they are working with something they don't know
	- AMA code of medical ethics
		- chapter 3
			- privacy is crucial, patients need to be able to trust that physicians will protect info shared in confidence
			- That big companies won't collect data, even though it may "improve the quality of the product"
			- confidentiality must be followed
#. Solution	
	- Make sure people who administer VR therapy are properly trained in it
		- \textbf{\textit{How would a patient know that they are an expert in it?}}
	- Need to conduct further studies on VR therapy to ensure effectiveness
	- Regulations on companies developing VR in regards to data collection (esp when it comes to medical data)
#. Future
	- education
	- video games
	- remote workplaces
	- entertainment (movies/television)
	- photography and videography
