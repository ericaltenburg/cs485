## Drones

#. Stakeholder: consumers
	- privacy issues
		- Amazon has a past of this
		- No legal repercussions
	- Freelance photographers
		- Monetary gain
		- Spectacular views
		- Close up of views of high places (hard to reach)
	- good Samaritans
		- Saving people, get out of woods, or if lost
	- hobby groups and flying clubs
		- Easy to operate
	- All groups must adhere to drone regulations
#. Stakeholder: law enforcement
	- Enforce laws
#. Stakeholder: FAA
	- Regulate safety and protect commercial aircraft and drones
	- 400 ft altitude limit
#. Stakeholder: Military
	- They have to be aware of drones
	- Cheaper and low point of entry
	- Never had to deal with this because 20 years ago it was planes
#. Disadvantages:
	- Software issues
		- Malfunctions high up, can be dangerous
		- Had this happen to me personally, needed to find places where it was safe to fly
	- People do not follow the rules
		- Endangering aircraft
		- Invasion of privacy
			- Celebrity and paparazzi
	- Possibility of drones being hacked
#. Ethical Concerns
	- Two biggest concerns: safety and privacy
	- They seem harmless, but can be dangerous when used improperly
		- We already have regulations designed to mitigate risk of harm
		- It is up to the user to follow them
	- Regulation on drone privacy is still lacking
		- It exists, but not exactly how you'd imagine
	- Personal drones can offer an endless stream of your data
#. Code of ethics
	- ACM 1.1: Contribute to society and to human wellbeing, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing
	- 1.6 respect privacy
		- Personal drones can collect more info about you than any other data collection tool that's branded as a product for you to use
		- It's a new medium to collect info, it isn't fleshed out yet
	- 1.7 Honor Confidentiality
		- The EU GDPR gave many rights to individuals trying to assess a company's stores of personal data of them
		- In august 2018, a man exercised these rights and requested a ZIP file from Amazon containing the data they kept on him, and received someone else's data
	- 2.6 Perform work only in areas of competence
	- 2.7 Design and implement systems that are robustly and usably secure
		- KNowing when not to take on a task is a major ethical responsibility of dev and all IT professionals
		- Allowing a vulnerability to deploy due to negligence can have repercussions that trickle into every little profession
#. Solutions
	- AI Tool that can find drone pilots flying too close to aircrafts or protected airspace
	- Addition of security software which makes it more difficult for drones to get hacked
	- Increase in infrastructure for monitoring drones
